Project: File Copy with System Calls
by Tyler Edwards and Jaden Johnson
Added October 2023

Description: Utilizing function calls, copy a pre-existing file on the user's computer. 

Language: C 

Reason: For CPSC 380 (Operating Systems)

Successes: I got to practice doing ressearch with a partner into new code syntax for functions I had never used before.

Setbacks: Having never used system calls directly while coding, learning to the syntax for them took awhile.

Learned: using system calls directly, giving file permissions in code


/*
Commands:
gcc syscpy.c -o syscpy -Wno-deprecated 
./syscpy input.txt output.txt

Output:
Success!
